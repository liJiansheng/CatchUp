    "\n",

    "    - Item attributes\n",
    "    - Item categories\n",
    "\n",
    "The webservice PokeAPI, is designed based on URL patterns, which can be used to retrieve data by topic, resource type, or attribute.  Also, we can use parameters with requests in order to control which data is retrieve as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example endpoints for querying the above data resources include:\n",

    "The following endpoints describe a URL address with an implied domain.  \n",

    "The convention these **endpoints** follow:\n",
    "\n",

    "For example, if our base url / domain was **pokeapi.co**, and our directory resource was  **api/v2/pokemon/55**, our **enpoint** would literally refer to the full URL: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/55\n",
